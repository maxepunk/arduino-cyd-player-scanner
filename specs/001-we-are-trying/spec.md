# Feature Specification: CYD Display Configuration Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-trying`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are trying to properly set up our display configurations for the two different Cheap Yellow Display variants we currently have at hand. We are working from ALNScanner0812Working.ino. Our best understanding of the situation is in CYD_COMPATIBILITY_STATUS.md and our best understanding of the current hardware configuration is HARDWARE_SPECIFICATIONS.md. We are working directly with the module plugged into the computer using the arduino-cli running natively on Raspberry Pi with native serial monitoring. We have established best practices for this. It's important that we collaborate with the user and leverage serial output to do this work successfully and efficiently. Currently, we have the ST display driver variant plugged in."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: working with two CYD hardware variants needing display configs
   ‚Üí Context: ALNScanner RFID scanner sketch as baseline
   ‚Üí Environment: Arduino-cli native on Raspberry Pi, arduino-cli monitor
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developer, Two CYD hardware variants (ST7789 and ILI9341)
   ‚Üí Actions: Configure displays, test functionality, use serial output
   ‚Üí Data: Display configurations, driver settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must work with both variants, Raspberry Pi environment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Display library configuration method resolved (TFT_eSPI User_Setup.h)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Configure display for each variant
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable via serial output or visual display
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Hardware variants, display configurations, test results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No major uncertainties remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer with two different CYD hardware variants (single USB with ILI9341 display and dual USB with ST7789 display), I need to configure the display settings so that the ALNScanner RFID scanner application works correctly on both devices, showing the user interface and images properly without requiring hardware modifications or different wiring between variants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CYD device with ST7789 display driver (dual USB variant) is connected, **When** the ALNScanner sketch is uploaded and run, **Then** the display shows the NeurAI Memory Scanner interface clearly with correct colors and orientation

2. **Given** a CYD device with ILI9341 display driver (single USB variant) is connected, **When** the ALNScanner sketch is uploaded and run, **Then** the display shows the NeurAI Memory Scanner interface clearly with correct colors and orientation

3. **Given** either CYD variant is running the sketch, **When** an RFID card is scanned, **Then** the corresponding BMP image displays correctly on the screen

4. **Given** the developer is testing a CYD variant, **When** viewing the serial monitor output, **Then** diagnostic information confirms the display initialization succeeded and identifies which driver is in use

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the wrong display driver configuration is used? System should provide clear diagnostic output indicating display communication failure
- How does system handle if display initialization fails? Application should continue running with RFID functionality intact, reporting status via serial output
- What if display works but colors are inverted or orientation is wrong? Serial commands should allow testing different display modes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST correctly display the user interface on CYD devices with ST7789 display controllers
- **FR-002**: System MUST correctly display the user interface on CYD devices with ILI9341 display controllers  
- **FR-003**: System MUST show BMP images from SD card with correct colors and orientation on both display types
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide serial output confirming successful display initialization and identifying the active driver
- **FR-005**: System MUST continue operating RFID scanning functionality even if display initialization fails
- **FR-006**: Developer MUST be able to test display functionality via serial commands without needing physical interaction
- **FR-007**: System MUST display text overlays (NDEF data, status messages) readably on both display variants
- **FR-008**: Display configuration MUST not interfere with other hardware components (RFID reader, SD card, touch sensor, audio)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CYD Hardware Variant**: Physical device type identified by display controller (ST7789 or ILI9341), USB configuration (single micro or dual micro+C), and GPIO pin mappings
- **Display Configuration**: Settings including driver type, SPI pins, control pins, color mode, rotation, and initialization sequence
- **Test Result**: Outcome of display test including initialization status, driver identification, and any error messages
