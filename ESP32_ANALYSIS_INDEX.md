## Key Findings Summary

### Backend Communication
The ESP32 scanner uses exactly **4 HTTP endpoints**:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Frequency |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| `/api/scan` | POST | Single scan submission | Real-time |
| `/api/scan/batch` | POST | Batch queue upload | Every 10s if connected |
| `/api/tokens` | GET | Token database sync | Boot time |
| `/health` | GET | Connection health check | Every 10s |

All requests use:
- 5-second timeout
- JSON request/response format
- HTTP or HTTPS (auto-detected)
- Device identification via `deviceId` parameter

### Critical Mismatches

1. **HTTPS Configuration**
   - ESP32 config only accepts `http://` URLs
   - Backend advertises HTTPS in discovery
   - Workaround: Backend provides HTTP redirect (port 8000)
   - Fix needed: Relax config validation to accept `https://`

2. **Timestamp Format**
   - ESP32 sends placeholder timestamps (millis()-based)
   - No RTC hardware on device
   - Recommendation: Backend should use server-side timestamps

3. **Team ID Format**
   - Strictly 3 digits (001-999)
   - No flexibility for other formats
   - Verify backend alignment

4. **Flash Memory**
   - Currently 92% capacity (tight)
   - Phase 6 optimization needed for new features
   - Target: <87% (save 57KB)

### Architecture Highlights

- **Layered Design:** HAL → Models → Services → UI → Application
- **Design Patterns:** Singleton, Facade, State Machine, RAII, Command Registry, Template Method
- **Thread Safety:** Spinlock for queue counter, RAII mutex for SD operations
- **Memory Safety:** Stream-based queue removal (100 bytes vs 10KB)
- **Code Quality:** 20 modular files, each <1,250 lines, clear responsibilities
