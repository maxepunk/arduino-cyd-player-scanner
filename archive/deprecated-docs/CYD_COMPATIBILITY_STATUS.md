# üöÄ CYD Multi-Hardware Compatibility Journey - Complete Status Report

## Executive Summary
We set out to create a universal RFID scanner sketch for multiple CYD (Cheap Yellow Display) variants. We discovered the hardware differences were simpler than expected, but the display library configuration is the real challenge.
**IMPORTANT**: This is our CURRENT understanding, but there may be errors in our understanding or analysis. ALWAYS verify our assertions before acting on them.

## üìä Key Discoveries

### Hardware Findings

#### Both CYD Variants Tested:
1. **Single USB (Micro) Variant**
   - MAC: f4:65:0b:a9:ea:e8
   - Display: Likely ILI9341 (based on original working config)
   - Backlight: **GPIO21** (NOT GPIO27!)
   - Status: ALNScanner0812Working runs, RFID works, **display stays black**

2. **Dual USB (Micro + Type-C) Variant**  
   - MAC: 78:1c:3c:e5:98:c4
   - Display: Likely ST7789 (based on hardware detection tests)
   - Backlight: **GPIO21** (NOT GPIO27!)
   - Status: Sketch crashes before setup(), no serial output

#### Critical Discovery: NO GPIO27 CONFLICT!
- **Both variants use GPIO21 for backlight**
- **GPIO27 is completely free for RFID MOSI**
- No multiplexing needed
- Our entire GPIO27 multiplexing approach was solving a non-existent problem

### Pin Configuration (IDENTICAL on both variants)
```
RFID (Software SPI):
- SCK: GPIO22
- MOSI: GPIO27 (FREE - no backlight conflict!)
- MISO: GPIO35  
- SS: GPIO3

SD Card (Hardware SPI/VSPI):
- SCK: GPIO18
- MOSI: GPIO23
- MISO: GPIO19
- CS: GPIO5

Touch: 
- IRQ: GPIO36 (IRQ-only, no SPI)

Backlight:
- GPIO21 (both variants!)
```

## üîç What Actually Works

### ALNScanner0812Working on Single USB Variant
‚úÖ **Serial communication** - Full debug output  
‚úÖ **RFID scanning** - Perfect card detection and NDEF reading  
‚úÖ **Touch IRQ** - Interrupt detection working  
‚úÖ **SD Card** - References files correctly  
‚ùå **Display** - Black screen (but sketch continues running)

### ALNScanner0812Working on Dual USB Variant
‚ùå **Everything** - Crashes before setup(), likely during TFT_eSPI global construction

### Test Sketches
‚úÖ **Minimal tests** (no TFT_eSPI) work on both  
‚úÖ **Hardware pin tests** confirm all pins accessible  
‚ùå **Any sketch with TFT_eSPI** has issues on one or both variants

---

## üí° The Real Problem

### It's NOT a hardware conflict - it's a display library configuration issue!

The TFT_eSPI library requires compile-time configuration in User_Setup.h for:
- Display driver (ILI9341 vs ST7789)  
- SPI pins for display
- Control pins (CS, DC, RST)
- SPI speed and mode

### Why ALNScanner0812Working Has Issues:

1. **Global TFT object construction**: `TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI();` happens before setup()
2. **Hardcoded SD pins** might conflict with display on some variants
3. **No pin override** for display - 100% relies on User_Setup.h
4. **Library configuration** is compiled for one specific variant

---

## üìù Current State of Implementation

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Hardware verification - both boards identified
- [x] RFID functionality confirmed on both with correct module
- [x] Touch IRQ-only implementation validated  
- [x] Discovered both use GPIO21 for backlight (major finding!)
- [x] Proved ALNScanner0812Working core logic is sound

### Tasks Blocked
- [ ] Display functionality on BOTH variants
- [ ] CYD_Multi_Compatible compilation (has naming conflicts)
- [ ] Runtime hardware detection (display driver differences)

---

## üéØ Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Two Binary Solution (Simplest)
1. Create two User_Setup.h configurations
2. Compile ALNScanner0812Working twice:
   - `ALNScanner_SingleUSB.bin` (ILI9341 config)
   - `ALNScanner_DualUSB.bin` (ST7789 config)
3. Users flash the correct one for their hardware

### Option 2: Fix Display Configuration (Best)
1. Research exact TFT_eSPI settings for each variant
2. Test with simple display-only sketches first
3. Consider using TFT_eSPI's built-in setup files:
   - `Setup24_ST7789.h` for one variant
   - `Setup16_ILI9341.h` for the other

### Option 3: Runtime Detection (Most Complex)
1. Fix CYD_Multi_Compatible compilation issues
2. Implement careful display initialization
3. Move TFT construction from global to dynamic allocation
4. Handle both variants at runtime

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes for Next Developer

### What's Misleading in Current Documentation
- **GPIO27 multiplexing is unnecessary** - both boards use GPIO21 for backlight
- **"Dual USB" doesn't mean GPIO27 backlight** - it also uses GPIO21
- **Hardware detection tests showed ST7789** but TFT_eSPI config might be wrong

### The Sketch May Be Too Aggressive
The ALNScanner0812Working sketch:
- Hardcodes SD card pins (might conflict)
- Creates global TFT object (crashes if pins wrong)
- Might benefit from giving more control back to TFT_eSPI library defaults

### Test Environment Quirks
- Arduino CLI runs natively on Raspberry Pi (Debian 12 / Bookworm)
- Native serial monitor via `arduino-cli monitor`
- Serial port is typically `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
- Initial serial output often missed (need reset while monitoring)

## üîÆ Final Verdict

**The hardware is simpler than we thought!** Both CYD variants are nearly identical except for the display controller chip. The solution isn't complex GPIO multiplexing - it's getting the TFT_eSPI library configured correctly for each variant.

The irony: We built elaborate solutions for a GPIO27 conflict that doesn't exist, when the real issue is basic display driver configuration.

**Next step should be**: Get a simple "Hello World" TFT_eSPI sketch working on each board FIRST, then integrate that knowledge back into the RFID scanner.

## üìå Environment Configuration

### Raspberry Pi Native Setup
```bash
# Arduino CLI on Raspberry Pi (native Linux)
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 [sketch]
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 [sketch]

# Serial monitoring (native support)
arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -c baudrate=115200
```

### Known Serial Port Assignments
- ESP32 boards typically appear as `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
- Port may change when boards are swapped
- Check with: `ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*`

### Legacy Environment (Deprecated)
**‚ö†Ô∏è The project was previously developed on WSL2 with Windows Arduino CLI.**
See `archive/deprecated-docs/WSL2_ARDUINO_SETUP.md` for historical reference.
