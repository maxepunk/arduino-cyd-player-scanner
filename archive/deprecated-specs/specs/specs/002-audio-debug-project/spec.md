# Feature Specification: Audio Debug Project - RFID Polling Beep Investigation

**Feature Branch**: `002-audio-debug-project`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "audio debug project. while the embedded system is searching for a card to read, the speaker beeks (quietly) at regular intervals that may be syncronized with the RFID polling, and we want to take the simplest, most elegant path to idenitfying why it's happening and fix the issue to improve our system functionality and make it more robust against potential undesired behavior down the line."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified: unwanted audio beeping during RFID scanning
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: system operator, RFID scanner system
   ’ Actions: scanning for cards, producing unwanted beeps
   ’ Data: audio output patterns, RFID polling cycles
   ’ Constraints: must preserve existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Beep frequency: correlates with RFID polling
   ’ Volume: described as "quiet"
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: unwanted beeping during card scanning
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focuses on user-observable behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Audio output behavior, RFID scanning state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator, when I power on the RFID scanner and it begins searching for cards to read, I hear unwanted beeping sounds from the speaker at regular intervals. The beeping stops when a card is successfully read. This audio feedback is unintended and should not occur during normal scanning operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the RFID scanner is powered on and searching for cards, **When** no card is present, **Then** the speaker should remain silent (no beeping sounds)
2. **Given** the RFID scanner is actively polling for cards, **When** the polling cycles execute, **Then** no audio artifacts should be produced
3. **Given** a card has been successfully read, **When** the system plays the intended audio file, **Then** only the designated audio file should play without preceding beeps
4. **Given** the system is idle after card processing, **When** returning to scanning mode, **Then** the speaker should remain silent until the next card is detected

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the audio system is initialized but no audio file is loaded?
- How does system handle the transition between RFID polling and audio playback?
- What occurs if the audio subsystem receives empty or uninitialized data?
- How should the system behave if audio initialization fails completely?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST NOT produce any audio output during RFID card scanning operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST only produce audio when explicitly playing designated sound files after successful card reads
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain complete silence between card read events
- **FR-004**: Audio subsystem MUST NOT interfere with RFID scanning functionality
- **FR-005**: RFID polling operations MUST NOT cause unintended audio artifacts
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide diagnostic capability to identify sources of unwanted audio
- **FR-007**: Any audio system modifications MUST NOT degrade existing RFID scanning performance
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle audio subsystem initialization without producing spurious sounds

### Key Entities
- **RFID Scanner State**: Represents the current scanning mode (idle, polling, reading, processing)
- **Audio Output State**: Represents audio subsystem status (silent, playing, error)
- **Polling Cycle**: The regular interval at which RFID scanner checks for card presence
- **Audio Buffer**: The memory area used for audio data that may be improperly initialized
