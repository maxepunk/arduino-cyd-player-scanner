# Feature Specification: CYD Multi-Hardware Compatibility Testing and Verification

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-were-working`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Input**: User description: "We were working on rebuilding @ALNScanner0812Working/ALNScanner0812Working_backup.ino to be compatible with ALL variations of the cheap yello display hardware. It was working with the micro usb iteration of the CYD module, but not the usbc/micro dual port version. We had built a new version along with test sketches to enable easy debugging and distinguishing of hardware/wiring failures vs. code issues. We did not have direct access to the arduino-cli and so could not directly run our new sketches to test and ensure proper implementation of our rebuilt sketch. I would like to finish this project by testing and verifying the successful implementation of our multi-compatible sketch. We currently have the dual port module plugged in with whatever sketch was last uploaded (which was not a functioning version)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified: CYD hardware compatibility, testing phase, dual port module connected
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Developer/tester
   � Actions: Test, verify, debug hardware compatibility
   � Data: Sketch versions, diagnostic output
   � Constraints: Current non-functioning sketch on device
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked with clarification needs
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear testing flow established
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable via serial output or visual confirmation
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Test sketches, main sketch, diagnostic data
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN: Some implementation context present but necessary for testing phase
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I need to verify that the rebuilt RFID scanner sketch works correctly on both single USB (micro) and dual USB (micro + Type-C) CYD hardware variants, preferably without requiring any wiring changes. When consistent wiring across variants is not technically possible, I need clear documentation of the specific wiring requirements for each hardware configuration, so that users can easily adapt their setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the dual port CYD module is connected with a non-functional sketch, **When** I upload and run diagnostic test sketches, **Then** I receive clear serial output identifying the hardware variant and component status
2. **Given** a component fails to initialize, **When** the diagnostic runs, **Then** the system clearly reports whether it's a hardware failure (physical defect/wiring) or software issue (configuration/compatibility)
3. **Given** hardware differences require different wiring, **When** the system detects the hardware variant, **Then** it displays specific, clear wiring instructions including pin numbers and connection diagrams
4. **Given** diagnostic tests confirm hardware is working, **When** I upload the multi-compatible main sketch, **Then** the RFID scanner functions correctly on the dual port variant
5. **Given** the main sketch is running on dual port hardware, **When** I scan an RFID card, **Then** the display shows the image and audio plays without errors
6. **Given** the working sketch on dual port hardware, **When** I upload the same sketch to single USB hardware with identical wiring, **Then** it functions without modification OR provides clear wiring change instructions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when hardware detection fails?
- How does system handle partial component failures?
- What diagnostic information is provided when RFID communication fails?
- How does the system report backlight control conflicts on dual port hardware?
- How does the system differentiate between disconnected hardware vs incorrect pin configuration?
- What specific tests identify wiring issues vs component defects?
- How does the system handle when identical wiring works for one variant but not another?
- What guidance is provided when a user has mixed hardware variants in their deployment?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and report the connected CYD hardware variant (single vs dual USB)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide comprehensive diagnostic output via serial monitor at startup
- **FR-003**: System MUST prioritize consistent wiring across hardware variants when technically feasible
- **FR-004**: System MUST display RFID card images on both hardware variants
- **FR-005**: System MUST play audio files associated with RFID cards on both variants
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle touch input correctly on both hardware types
- **FR-007**: System MUST report component initialization status for display, touch, SD card, and RFID
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages when components fail to initialize
- **FR-009**: System MUST distinguish between hardware failures and software issues in diagnostics by analyzing communication patterns, response timeouts, and electrical characteristics
- **FR-010**: Test sketches MUST validate each component independently before full integration testing
- **FR-011**: System MUST report specific failure modes: disconnected hardware, wiring errors, power issues, or software configuration problems
- **FR-012**: Diagnostics MUST differentiate between "no response" (likely hardware) and "incorrect response" (likely software/config)
- **FR-013**: When wiring differences are unavoidable, system MUST provide variant-specific wiring diagrams in serial output
- **FR-014**: System MUST document exact pin mappings for each hardware variant including connector labels (P1, P3, CN1)
- **FR-015**: Wiring guidance MUST include both textual descriptions and ASCII art diagrams for clarity
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate current wiring against expected configuration and suggest corrections if mismatched

### Key Entities
- **Main Sketch**: The multi-compatible RFID scanner application that adapts to hardware variants
- **Test Sketches**: Individual component validation programs for display, touch, RFID, and SD card
- **Diagnostic Data**: Serial output providing hardware detection results and component status
- **Hardware Variant**: Identified configuration (single USB vs dual USB) affecting pin assignments
- **Component Status**: Initialization state of each hardware component (display, touch, RFID, SD, audio)
- **Failure Classification**: Categorization of issues as hardware (physical/electrical) or software (logic/configuration)
- **Diagnostic Report**: Structured output identifying failure type, probable cause, and suggested remediation
- **Wiring Configuration**: Pin assignments and connection requirements specific to each hardware variant
- **Wiring Guidance**: Clear instructions with diagrams showing how to connect components for each CYD variant
