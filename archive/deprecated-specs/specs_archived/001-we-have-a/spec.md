# Feature Specification: CYD Multi-Model Compatibility Update

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-have-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we have a working sketch for the Cheap Yellow Display Resistive 2.8\" screen with micro usb model (@ALNSCANNER0812Working.ino) that is not working with a different (2 usb - c and micro) model properly, we need to update the sketch to be compatible with all iterations of the cheap yellow display R units."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Arduino developer using Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) hardware, I need my RFID scanner sketch (ALNScanner0812Working.ino) with full functionality (display, touch, RFID, SD card, and audio) to work across all CYD Resistive 2.8" model variants (single USB micro, dual USB with micro+Type-C) so that I can deploy the same code regardless of which CYD model I have.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a working sketch on single USB micro CYD model, **When** uploaded to dual USB CYD model, **Then** all display, touch, RFID, SD card, and audio functions work correctly
2. **Given** different CYD hardware variants with varying pin configurations, **When** the sketch starts, **Then** it automatically detects and configures for the correct model
3. **Given** a CYD with ST7789 display driver (dual USB), **When** running the sketch, **Then** display renders correctly with proper colors and orientation
4. **Given** a CYD with ILI9341 display driver (single USB), **When** running the sketch, **Then** display renders correctly without manual code changes
5. **Given** different backlight GPIO pins across models (GPIO21 vs GPIO27), **When** sketch initializes, **Then** backlight turns on correctly
6. **Given** incorrect wiring or hardware failure, **When** sketch detects the issue, **Then** detailed diagnostic information is output via serial including specific pin failures and suggested fixes

### Edge Cases & Constraints
- **Critical Constraint**: Solution must work with existing wiring - no physical connection changes allowed
- What happens when unknown CYD model variant is detected? System must report detailed model detection failure with available diagnostic data
- How does system handle partial hardware failures (e.g., touch works but display doesn't)? Must report specific component failure with diagnostic details
- What happens if SD card or RFID module is not connected? Must detect absence and report which pins show no response
- How does system behave if wrong display driver is initially detected? Must attempt recovery and provide detailed debugging output
- How are wiring issues diagnosed? System must test each connection and report specific failures with pin numbers and expected signals

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect CYD hardware model variant at runtime (single USB vs dual USB)
- **FR-002**: System MUST configure correct display driver (ILI9341 for single USB, ST7789 for dual USB)
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle different GPIO pin mappings for backlight (GPIO21 vs GPIO27)
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain touch functionality across all CYD variants with proper calibration
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve RFID reading capability using software SPI on all models
- **FR-006**: System MUST support SD card operations on all CYD variants
- **FR-007**: System MUST display RFID card data and BMP images correctly regardless of model
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain full audio output functionality (WAV playback via I2S) on all CYD model variants
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive diagnostic feedback including: detected hardware model, pin configurations in use, component initialization status, and specific error messages for each subsystem (display, touch, RFID, SD card, audio)
- **FR-010**: System MUST fall back gracefully when optional hardware components are missing
- **FR-011**: System MUST work with existing wiring configuration without requiring ANY physical hardware connection changes
- **FR-012**: System MUST detect and report wiring issues with detailed diagnostics including: expected vs actual pin connections, signal integrity problems, SPI communication failures, and suggested corrective actions
- **FR-013**: System MUST output detailed serial debug information for troubleshooting including: initialization sequence progress, detected voltages/signals, communication attempts/failures, and timestamp for each diagnostic event

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CYD Hardware Model**: Represents the detected display variant (model type, USB configuration, display driver, GPIO mappings)
- **Display Configuration**: Contains display-specific settings (driver type, resolution, color order, inversion state, backlight pin)
- **Touch Configuration**: Stores touch controller settings (calibration values, pin assignments, IRQ handling)
- **RFID Configuration**: Maintains RFID reader settings (SPI pins, timing parameters, retry counts)
