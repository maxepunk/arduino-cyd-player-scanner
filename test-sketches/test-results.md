# SPI Protocol Test Results
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Feature**: 001-we-are-trying (ALNScanner Software SPI Fix)

## Test 11: SPI Protocol Verification ✅ COMPLETE

### Test Results:
1. **GPIO3/RX Pin Control**: ✅ PASSED
   - Toggled GPIO3 10 times: Serial survived
   - Held GPIO3 LOW for 100ms: Serial survived  
   - Held GPIO3 HIGH for 100ms: Serial survived
   - Rapid toggle (1000 cycles in 4ms): Serial survived
   - **CONCLUSION: GPIO3 manipulation does NOT break serial**

2. **SPI Mode 0 Verification**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
   - Clock idle LOW confirmed (CPOL=0)
   - Data transfer works but responses are incorrect:
     - Sent 0xAA → Received 0xAC (expected 0x00 if no device)
     - Multiple bytes show inconsistent patterns (0x6B, 0x0, 0x0, 0x6, 0xBB)
   - **CONCLUSION: SPI signals working but MFRC522 not responding correctly**

### Critical Finding:
**GPIO3/UART RX conflict theory is DISPROVEN!** The serial failure in ALNScanner must come from:
1. The actual MFRC522 initialization sequence
2. Critical sections during extended multi-byte operations
3. Something specific in ALNScanner's implementation (not GPIO3 itself)

### Implications:
- Can continue using GPIO3 as RFID_SS (no rewiring needed)
- Focus shifts to MFRC522 communication and critical section timing
- Need to verify if MFRC522 is actually connected/powered properly

## Test 12: MFRC522 Version Register ❌ FAILED

### Test Results:
1. **Version Register Reads**: ❌ INCORRECT VALUES
   - Without critical section: 0xC6
   - With critical section: 0xF6
   - Expected: 0x91 or 0x92
   - Consistent 0xF6 on repeated reads

2. **Critical Section Impact**: ⚠️ AFFECTS READINGS
   - Different values with/without critical sections
   - Suggests timing affects SPI communication
   - But neither value is valid for MFRC522

3. **Serial Communication**: ✅ SURVIVED
   - Serial works perfectly throughout test
   - Further confirms GPIO3 is not the issue

### Critical Finding:
**MFRC522 is NOT responding correctly!** Getting 0xF6 instead of 0x91/0x92 means:
- MFRC522 powered (LED is on per user) but not communicating properly
- Could be wiring issue (MISO/MOSI swapped?)
- Could need proper reset/initialization sequence
- Could be SPI protocol mismatch

### Hardware Investigation Needed:
- User confirms MFRC522 LED is ON (power OK)
- Need to verify wiring connections
- May need to test with hardware SPI first
- Could be both hardware AND software issues

## Next Steps:
- Investigate MFRC522 hardware connection
- Test 13: Measure critical section impact thresholds
- Test 14: Compare different SPI implementation strategies
- Test 15: Progressive MFRC522 init to find exact failure point
